"""
This file inherits the spirit of an Amazon article I read a while back about
how much Amazon communicates via APIs of all their team / services ... it forces them
to make well-thought APIs. Since I have a bit of historical data from Excel that I'm
importing - I had two options. 1) Just use django's native methods (get_or_create, etc)
or 2) eat my own dog food and use post/puts to create the historical data. I've tested
1) and I know it works ... but I've decided to with option 2 since empirically a
battle-tested API will make the eventual iOS / Android apps much easier to develop.
